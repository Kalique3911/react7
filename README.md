An SPA representing a social network built with ReactJS.

## Description

This is a project in which I learned web development, namely front-end development. During the development of
this project, I understood how the browser and web applications work, how the architecture of the web application
is built, got to know how to optimize it and what are the principles of its design, also learned many other aspects of
web development.
Over the course of numerous commits, this social network has evolved from older technologies to the power of
modern JavaScript and React. This project serves as a testament to continuous learning and improvement.
